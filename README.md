# kilter_brain_gen

Generating kilter board problems with transformers

## TODO

- [ ] Train a model for route names that actually works
- [ ] Tidy everything up with a nice CLI framework
- [ ] Add similarity search
- [ ] Somehow specify windows-specific dependencies that grab torch with CUDA support

### Experiments

- [ ] Try adding duplicate climbs with randomized frame data
- [ ] Try different sampling strategies for climb data
